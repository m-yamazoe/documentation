Notifications
-------------

enStratus has granular control over which events will trigger a notification as well as the mechanisms by which the notifications will be delivered. 
This section describes how to set both the notification targets and the events that will trigger a notification/alert.

Account administrators can set separate preferences for each account; individual users can also control how (and when) they receive alerts and notifications.
