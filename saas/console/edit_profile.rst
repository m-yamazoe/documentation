   Profile Security Credentials

Users can also add RDP password and SSH key details from within their profiles. 

Once the credentials have been entered and the profile is saved, the user can then access
remote servers as outlined in the Compute > Servers section through Shell/Remote
access provided they have the appropriate access rights to take this action.
