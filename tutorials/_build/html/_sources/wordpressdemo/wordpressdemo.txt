Wordpress Demo
--------------

.. note:: Estimated time to complete this tutorial will vary based on several factors such
   as the speed of the cloud provider, and the skill level of the operator.

   New Guy, no SSH skills, no Linux: 1 mo.

   SSH/Firewall skills, cloud-savvy: 2 hrs, maybe less.

   Cloud god: 1 hr.

Purpose
~~~~~~~
The purpose of this document is to start from scratch and build a deployable enStratus
application architecture including a Wordpress web application backed by a MySQL database.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Users seeking to successfully complete this tutorial must have the following items/skills.

#. A cloud account or cloud accounts connected to enStratus. EC2 is the cloud I will cover
   here.
#. Cloud files (object) storage
#. Familiarity with SSH.
   
   Users will need to be able to use the secure copy program (scp) or an equivalent to
   move the chef cookbook used to prepare the image.

#. Rudimentary familiarity with the Linux operating system command line. However, most of
   the instructions should be copy-and-paste.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

.. note:: Some of the step are purposefully suboptimal to illustrate the process at hand.
   There are usually many ways to approach the processes we're describing, this is just
   one.


Make Image
~~~~~~~~~~
To make an image, start with a generic EC2 image from `Alestic <http://alestic.com/>`_.
Eric's team has recently begun publishing only 64-bit images. Any generic ubuntu image
*should* work, but this tutorial has only been tested with images from Alestic.

   Search for AMI

1. Start the image as a VM, choose a large product size, not t1.micro for best results.
   Also, generate and use an SSH key during the launch.

.. figure:: ./images/ami1.png

   Launch, General Information

Save the key and chmod it

.. code-block:: bash

   chmod 600 demoKey

   :width: 1200 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Launch, Create/Use Key
   :align: center

   Launch, Create/Use Key

2. While the image launches, open the firewall so you can access port 22 from your
   location.
3. Once the VM is started, copy the wordpress-demo-prep.tar.gz file to the instance.
   The command to do so will be something of the form:

.. code-block:: bash

   scp -i demoKey wordpress-demo-prep.tar.gz ubuntu@ip.of.running.instance:~

4. Next, ssh onto the running instance, and take root:

.. code-block:: bash

   ssh -i theKey ubuntu@ip.of.running.instance

   sudo su

5. Install the chef client:

.. code-block:: bash

   echo "deb http://apt.opscode.com/ `lsb_release -cs`-0.10 main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/opscode.list
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d
   gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 83EF826A
   gpg --export packages@opscode.com | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/opscode-keyring.gpg > /dev/null
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y upgrade
   sudo apt-get -y install chef

6. Extract the wordpress-demo-prep.tar.gz file:

.. code-block:: bash

   tar -xzf wordpress-demo-prep.tar.gz

7. Execute the chef-solo run:

.. code-block:: bash

   chef-solo -j node.json -c solo.rb

During this step, some packages necessary for running a typical LAMP stack application
will be installed, along with the latest enStratus agent. Depending on your connection and
mirror speeds, this may take up to 5-7 minutes.

The purpose of this step is to prepare the image for running PHP and MySQL applications,
not to install the application itself, that comes later durin the launch and orchestration
steps of a deployment launch.

Once this step completes, initiate the build of the machine image from within the
enStratus console.

.. warning:: If the image is not built using the server actions > Make Image menu option
  in the enStratus console, it will not be available for use in the deployment. This measure
  is in place to protect users from attempting to use an image that does not have the agent
  on it for automation.

.. note:: As a sanity check that the agent is working, you should see an expanded list of
  options in the actions menu as shown.

.. figure:: ./images/makeImage1.png
   :height: 700px
   :width: 2200 px
   :scale: 45 %
   :alt: Server, Make Image
   :align: center

   Server, Make Image

Once this process completes, select action > Make Image from the server's action menu.

   :height: 300px
   :width: 700 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Make Image
   :align: center

   Make Image

While the image builds, it's time to upload the service images for use by enStratus.

Upload Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Automation > Service Images, upload wordpress.tar.gz and mysql.tar.gz as service
image files. enStratus stores these files in cloud files storage and will initiate a
download of these files at launch time by the enStratus agent.

.. figure:: ./images/serviceUpload0.png
   :height: 300px
   :width: 700 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Service Upload, Wordpress
   :align: center

   :height: 300px
   :width: 700 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Service Upload, MySQL
   :align: center

   Service Upload, MySQL

Once this action is complete, there will be (minimally) 2 services.

.. figure:: ./images/serviceUpload2.png
   :height: 500px
   :width: 2100 px
   :scale: 45 %
   :alt: Services Uploaded
   :align: center

   Services Uploaded

Upload DataSource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using Automation > Datasource, upload wordpresscontent.tar.gz as datasource files.
enStratus stores datasource files in cloud files storage and will initiate a download of
this file to services that are configured to have datasources.

.. figure:: ./images/dataSourceUpload0.png
   :height: 300px
   :width: 700 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Data Source, Upload
   :align: center

   :height: 400px
   :width: 2100 px
   :scale: 45 %
   :alt: Data Source, Upload
   :align: center

   Data Source, Upload

Design Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that those steps are complete, it's time to start building the application
architecture. 

First, create a new deployment by navigating to Automation > Designer. If you have not yet
created a deployment, a placeholder image greets you:

.. figure:: ./images/deployment0.png
   :height: 800px
   :width: 1500 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer

To create a new deployment, select the actions menu and choose Create a New Deployment.

.. figure:: ./images/deployment1.png
   :height: 800px
   :width: 1500 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Create New Deployment
   :align: center

   :height: 800px
   :width: 1500 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Create Tier
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer, Create Tier


Create Tiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Use the designer diagram to add a tier. Give the tier a high-level generic name like
   Application Tier. Tiers can hold many services, and we'll give a more specific name for
   the services. This tier will house only one service for this tutorial, the wordpress
   application.

   :height: 750px
   :width: 1100 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Add Tier
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer, Add Tier

When the tier is added, the designer diagram is updated.

   :height: 600px
   :width: 1300 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Add Tier
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer, Add Tier


2. Use the desginer diagram to add another tier. Give the tier a name like Database Tier.
   This tier will hold the MySQL service.

.. figure:: ./images/deployment5.png
   :height: 750px
   :width: 1100 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Add Tier
   :align: center

   :height: 600px
   :width: 1300 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Deployment Designer, Add Tier
   :align: center

   Deployment Designer, Add Tier

Add Services
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Adding services to tiers means telling enStratus what service should be installed on
servers running in the tier. This action only needs to be completed once, no matter how
many regions/clouds the tier spans.

To add a service to a tier, select the tier by clicking on it in the designer diagram and
choose +add service. enStratus will present the list of the services available for
attaching to the tier. This list should have at a minimum the two services uploaded above. 

.. figure:: ./images/addService0.png
   :height: 400px
   :width: 700 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Add Service, Wordpress
   :align: center

   Add Service, Wordpress

.. note:: If there was a previously running deployment where automated backups were made,
  it is also possible to tell enStratus to use a previously generated backup as a service.

  Pretty cool.

   :height: 400px
   :width: 700 px
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: Add Service, MySQL
   :align: center

   Add Service, MySQL

Associate the wordpress service with the application tier and the mysql service with the
database tier.

   :height: 600px
   :width: 2100 px
   :scale: 45 %
   :alt: Services Added
   :align: center

   Services Added

Next, it's time to configure the services. Configuring services means telling enStratus
what the relationship is, if any, between the services and what information should be
passed to dynamically configure the service at run time.

Ports
~~~~~
The ports option in the actions menu for services allows the application designer to
specify ports information that will be passed to the service at run time.

For the MySQL service, make the ports setting as shown:

.. figure:: ./images/ports0.png
   :height: 500px

Data Source
^^^^^^^^^^^
The Datasource options in actions menu for services allows the application designer to
associate a starting datasource with a database service. On the MySQL service, associate
the datasource uploaded earlier as shown:

The MySQL service is special, enStratus will execute a routine to install a datasource
once the mysql service is configured. On the MySQL service, choose actions > Data Sources

Set Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This step is critical. Dependencies let enStratus know how to *orchestrate* the deployment
launch and service configuration.

For this tutorial, we're going to set a dependency for the wordpress service. It's going
to depend on the *data source* installed as part of the MySQL service. What this means is
that at run time, enStratus will ensure:

1. The MySQL service is installed and successfully configured
2. The datasource is successfully installed on the MySQL service.

and then, and only then will

3. The application service be installed, since it *depends* on steps 1 and 2.

To set up a dependency, select the actions menu on the wordpress service.

   Dependency, Saved

Configure Launch Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The next and final thing to do is to configure virtual resources to use in the deployment.
By now, the imaged we prepared earlier should be ready for use in the launch
configuration.

In these steps, we'll tell enStratus what Image to use when starting servers, along with
what firewall into which the servers will be started.

.. note:: For this tutorial, we'll be using the same image for both launch configurations.
  In practice, this would probably not be the case, as a dedicate image would be used to
  support the application, and likewise the database.

Set an image for use in each of the launch configurations, as shown:

.. figure:: ./images/lc1.png
   :height: 1100px
   :width: 1300 px
   :scale: 50 %

Once the initial launch configurations are set, click on the launch configuration, scroll
to the bottom, and use the previously created firewall.

Set Scaling Rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default, enStratus will set the deployment tiers to use a minimum/maximum server value
of 1/1 in each tier. We'll work on scaling the deployment later.

Launch Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The deployment is now configured for launch.
