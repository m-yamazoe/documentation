Updating enStratus
==================

enStratus software is under continuous development and improvement. From time to time, it
may be necessary to patch or update certain components of enStratus between releases.
This section is organized by the update "type". For example, if an enStratus developer or
engineer provides you with a new jar to deploy to your environment, there may be a
requirement to update configuration files or restart an enStratus component for the update
to take effect.
